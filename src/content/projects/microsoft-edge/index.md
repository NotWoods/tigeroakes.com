In Microsoft Edge, I worked on the new `edge://apps` experience. Edge's web app management UI was redesigned and rebuilt to provide more features and increase user engagement. This overhauled experience was featured in [Microsoft Build 2022](https://youtu.be/ahO5nePl4BQ?t=456) and the [Microsoft Edge Blog](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2022/05/24/microsoft-edge-build-2022/).

To ensure Microsoft Edge was accessible to all, I focused on keyboard support throughout the interface. The Apps Hub went from being keyboard inaccessible to having complex grid navigation features.
