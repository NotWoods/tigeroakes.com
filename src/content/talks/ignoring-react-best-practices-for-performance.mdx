Have you ever wanted to break the rules and be a React troublemaker? I’ll show you how ignoring React’s best practices can improve performance, all without major rewrites to your codebase. To understand how, we’ll learn when React decides to render and how to trick it to render less frequently. We’ll build components that don’t render anything, conditionally call hooks, and even use a piece of Svelte - all to quickly fix real performance problems I encountered at Microsoft.
