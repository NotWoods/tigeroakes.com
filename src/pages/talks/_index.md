At conferences, I speak about the future of the web and unique applications for tech. I've talked about art projects I've built out of old devices, including [junk phone wall decor](/talks/build-cell-wall/) and an [e-reader tea menu](/talks/e-reader-tea-menu/). I incorporate my improv experience to make engaging, memorable, comedic talks (sometimes [bantering with my wife & speaking partner onstage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DQU4D6dHWE))!

Interesting in having me speak at an upcoming event? [Send me a message!](/#contact)
