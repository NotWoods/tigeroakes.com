In Microsoft Edge, I worked on the new `edge://apps` experience. Edge's web app management UI was redesigned and rebuilt to provide more features and increase user engagement.

To ensure Microsoft Edge was accessibble to all, I focused on keyboard support throughout the interface. The Apps Hub went from being keyboard inaccessible to having complex grid navigation features.
