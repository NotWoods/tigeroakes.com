A character builder for the [Quest TTRPG](https://www.adventure.game/), in the vein of D&D Beyond and other similar tools for other tabletop role-playing games. Characters are synced in Firebase and information is scraped from the Quest rulebook PDF file. This lets players use a familiar interface without the need to copy and paste the rules in source code.
