For teenager, buds of life bloom without boundaries.
====================================================

It's generally not a problem when the IT manager/webmaster/telecommunications
adviser for Oakes Management needs an afternoon off to attend to a personal
project - provided, of course, the office systems are running smoothly and
he's done all his homework.

Not to worry. At 15 years old, Hawi resident Tiger Oakes has already learned
to make the most of his time. In addition, to working at his parents' resort
residence construction and management business and attending online classes at
Myron B. Thompson Academy, Oakes is a budding high-tech entrepreneur.

Just this year, Oakes' first go at a mobile application,
a multilevel puzzle game called BitBall - found a place on the virtual shelf next
to Angry Birds and Solitare in the Android marketplace. Oakes is collaborating
with friends to develop a detective game.

"I try to come up with ideas that are unique," Oakes says after a thoughtful pause.
"There are a lot of games out there, and it doesn't make sense to repeat what is
already avaliable."

To be sure, Oakes is as much a savvy businessman as he is a precocious techical talent,
as much as Jobs as a Wozniak.

Oakes says he's been facinated by computers since he was a toddler.
From the beginning he _____________

"I was hooked," Oakes said. "As I got older I wanted to _________."

Oakes ________________________________ Oakes would construct his own computers.

At Thompson Academy, Oakes found a ideal enviornment in which to develop his
interests, working closely with teacher Derrick Lord to learn programming and
to eventually design his own projects.

A self-described nerd, Oakes is hardly one-dimensional. He enjoys conputer games,
yes, but he also enjoys cycling and playing golf. He is an avid reader and a
two-time finallist in the annual Hawaii Botball Robotics competition.

Tall and lanky, with a careful ___________________.

He is still a kig, after all. And there is no app for that.
