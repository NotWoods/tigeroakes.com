<h2 class="section__title">About me</h2>

After growing up with dead zones in Hawaii, I want to make web apps that work offline and load fast. I've worked on Progressive Web App support in [Firefox for Android](/projects/mozilla-firefox/), and I'm a maintainer for the [Rollup](/projects/rollup/) JavaScript bundler. Previously, I worked on web projects for [Google Chrome](/projects/google) and [Yelp](/projects/yelp).

I currently study computer science at the University of British Columbia, and I'm headed to Microsoft in 2021. Some of my side [projects](/projects/) have been featured in [Washington, DC](https://gabbard.house.gov/news/press-releases/rep-tulsi-gabbard-presents-congressional-awards-young-leaders-hawai-i-s-second) and outlets such as [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/maskable-icons-android-adaptive-icons-for-your-pwa/), [Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/12/nic79#maskable-icons), [web.dev](https://web.dev/maskable-icon-audit/), the [Star-Advertiser](/featured-in/star-advertiser) and [Hawai'i Public Radio](http://www.bytemarkscafe.org/2015/04/29/episode-348-sounding-rockets-apr-29-2015/).

I started programming in secondary school and enjoyed it so much I'm still doing it! In my spare time, I search for geocaches with [my partner](https://daphneliu.com).

Below is my resume, and I hope you enjoy exploring my site. If you'd like to get in touch or if you have questions about my work, don't hesitate to [contact me](/#contact).
