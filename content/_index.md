I'm Tiger Oakes and I'm a software developer studying computer science at the University of British Columbia. I'm currently looking for 2021 new grad positions. I've previously interned as a developer at [Mozilla](/projects/mozilla), [Google](/projects/google), [Yelp](/projects/yelp), and [more](/resume).

I started programming in secondary school and enjoyed it so much I'm still doing it! I started with robotics and visual programming languages in Hawai'i. Now, I work on complex web applications and software for various devices. I've worked on 2 different web browsers and many different web applications. I'm also a maintainer for the [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) JavaScript bundler.

Some of my side [projects](/projects/) have been featured in [Washington, DC](https://gabbard.house.gov/news/press-releases/rep-tulsi-gabbard-presents-congressional-awards-young-leaders-hawai-i-s-second) and outlets such as [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/maskable-icons-android-adaptive-icons-for-your-pwa/), [Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/12/nic79#maskable-icons), [web.dev](https://web.dev/maskable-icon-audit/), the [Star-Advertiser](/featured-in/star-advertiser) and [Hawai'i Public Radio](http://www.bytemarkscafe.org/2015/04/29/episode-348-sounding-rockets-apr-29-2015/).

Below is a portfolio of my projects. If you'd like to get in touch or if you have questions about my work, don't hesitate to [contact me](#contact).
