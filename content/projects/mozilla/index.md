  At Mozilla, I was trusted with bringing support for Progressive Web Apps
  to the new Firefox Preview browser for Android.
---

Firefox Preview is an upcoming rewrite of Mozilla's Firefox browser for Android.
I work on the Mozilla Android Components team to bring support for
Progressive Web Apps to Firefox Preview and other Mozilla Android browsers.
We shipped the browser to over 100,000 users on Google Play Store and I've
worked on various features and polish throughout the entire app.
