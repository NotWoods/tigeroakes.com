An online guidebook I'm writing about the [MockK testing library](https://mockk.io/). MockK is a popular library for creating mocks. It was written in Kotlin for Kotlin, and as a result the syntax is nicer than other mocking libraries.

MockK currently lacks strong documentation and has fewer resources related to it online than other libraries. This book is designed to help Kotlin developers learn how to use MockK, whether they're new to mocking or transitioning from another framework like Mockito.
