Latch On is a prototype game I developed, where the player uses a grappling hook
to swing around and navigate puzzles and platforms.
The game uses the **Unity** engine.

Since the initial prototype, I've been developing the idea into a full game as a
side project. A demo of the newer game can also be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/NotWoods/latch-on/releases).
