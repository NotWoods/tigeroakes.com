summary: >
  My current project: a program designed to be used by the farmers and
  researchers at the Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm. The
  software allows researchers to analyze data inputted by users at the farm,
  while using algorithms to reduce repetition of data for the farmers.
