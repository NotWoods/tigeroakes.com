A few months after graduating from UBC,
I worked in a freelance capacity with a small vacation home rental business
on the design and development of a website with a custom CMS
for managing rental bookings and modifying website content.
I took the project from the initial requirements phase through to
design and eventual launch, and provided post-launch support as required.

The project is powered by ASP.NET MVC, and most of the public-facing pages
are generated by ASP's Razor HTML templating engine using information stored
in a SQL Server 2012 database. The CMS backend uses Bootstrap, jQuery,
and code-first Entity Framework to give the client the ability to
modify public-facing content while also handling administrative tasks
such as organizing bookings and running reports on historical booking information.

As my first true beginning-to-end software project,
I learned a lot about software development in general from this website,
and a lot about web development in particular.
I learned a lot about how to do things, and more importantly how not to do things,
and these lessons have informed the design and implementation decisions I make today.
