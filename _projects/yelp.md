For my intern project at Yelp, I helped create a new feature on the desktop 
website to make it easier for users to request quotes from home services businesses.
Rather than search for a business and write a message to them from scratch, 
["Describe Your Project"](https://yelp.com/describe_your_project?category=movers) 
lets users answer multiple-choice questions before they are presented with 
businesses to send their request to.

I wrote many of the React components in the page and the Redux reducers used to
store dynamic data. To share code across some of Yelp's microservices, I wrote
a Python package to encapsulate the shared logic.
