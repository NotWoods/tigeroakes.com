The Golden Quest is a voice-only, interactive Choose Your Own Adventure game.
Created in 24 hours at the nwHacks 2017 hackathon,
using the Node.js **Amazon Alexa API**.

Nobody on our team had previous experience working with Alexa, so we all learned
during the short hackathon timespan. We also had to write a short story for the
game. To make this easier, I used **regular expressions** to create a simple
format for the [story file](https://github.com/NotWoods/the-golden-quest/blob/master/story.txt).
