summary: >
  To visualize data generated by electricity monitoring devices, I created an 
  app that could parse files generated by monitoring systems in Myron B. 
  Thompson Academy and transform them into graphs. Data views could be changed,
  and custom data could be uploaded by clients. With this program, students 
  were able to  identify odd electricity usage, such as a spike in power used 
  by the refigerator at 4am.
