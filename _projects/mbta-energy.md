summary: >
  An app I created to visualize data generated by electricity monitoring devices, transforming it into graphs. Data views could be changed,
  and custom data could be uploaded by users. With this program, students 
  were able to  identify odd electricity usage, such as a power spike from 
  the refigerator at 4am.
