summary: >
  To visualize data generated by electricity monitoring devices, I created a 
  website that could parse files generated by monitoring systems in Myron B. 
  Thompson Academy and transform them into graphs. Data could be filtered to 
  show average power consumption, and custom files could be uploaded without 
  the need to update the server. Using this program, students were able to 
  identify odd electricity usage, such as a spike in power used by the 
  refigerator at 4am.
