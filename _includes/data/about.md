I'm Tiger Oakes and I'm a software developer studying computer science at
the University of British Columbia. I'm currently in the co-op program.

I started programming in secondary school and enjoyed it so much
I'm still doing it! I started with robotics and visual programming
languages in Hawai'i. Now, I work on complex web applications and
software for various devices.

Some of my side [projects](/projects/) have been featured in
[Washington, DC](https://gabbard.house.gov/news/press-releases/rep-tulsi-gabbard-presents-congressional-awards-young-leaders-hawai-i-s-second)
and news outlets such as the [Star Advertiser](/featured-in/star-advertiser),
[West Hawai'i Today](/featured-in/west-hawaii-today)
and [Hawai'i Public Radio](http://www.bytemarkscafe.org/2015/04/29/episode-348-sounding-rockets-apr-29-2015/).

Below is a portfolio of my projects. If you'd like to get in touch or if you
have questions about my work, don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact/).
