I'm Tiger Oakes and I'm a software developer studying computer science at
the University of British Columbia.

I started programming in secondary school and enjoyed it so much
I'm still doing it! I started with robotics and visual programming
languages in Hawai'i. Now, I work on complex web applications and
software for various devices.

Some of my side [projects](/projects/) have been featured in
[Washington, DC](https://gabbard.house.gov/news/press-releases/rep-tulsi-gabbard-presents-congressional-awards-young-leaders-hawai-i-s-second)
and news outlets such as the [Star Advertiser](http://www.staradvertiser.com/2012/07/31/hawaii-news/for-teenager-buds-of-life-bloom-without-boundaries/),
[West Hawai'i Today](http://westhawaiitoday.com/news/local-news/hele-schedule-be-available-app)
and [Hawai'i Public Radio](http://www.bytemarkscafe.org/2015/04/29/episode-348-sounding-rockets-apr-29-2015/).

Below is a portfolio of my projects. If you'd like to get in touch or if you
have questions about my work, don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact/).
